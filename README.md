# spotlight
Spotlight is a project made both for students and video lecturers. A lecturer often uploads his lectures to YouTube only. But as we know YouTube is full of other stuffs that can easily distract a student from his goal. So we developed project Spotlight. Lecturers can now upload the video to YouTube and add the link to Spotlight. Now whenever a user searches for a video spotlight directly streams it from YouTube. This way it saves both the server space and server load and does not require a content creator to upload a video twice
