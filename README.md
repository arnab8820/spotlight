# spotlight - A video library 
Spotlight is a project made both for students and video lecturers. A lecturer often uploads his lectures to YouTube only. But as we know YouTube is full of other stuffs that can easily distract a student from his goal. So we developed project Spotlight. Lecturers can now upload the video to YouTube and add the link to Spotlight. Now whenever a user searches for a video spotlight directly streams it from YouTube. This way it saves both the server space and server load and does not require a content creator to upload a video twice(once in YouTube and once in Spotlight).

Spotlight projects has two parts. One is for students who can search videos by keyword, Subject or audio language. 
Another part is for content creators. They have to first log in and they can add new videos as well as maintain previously uploaded videos.
